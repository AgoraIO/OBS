     download [deps](https://github.com/AgoraIO/OBS/releases/download/3.6.200/deps.zip), After unzip deps.zip, copy deps to folder agora-tool-ui.If you need update agora sdk, donwload lastes version [agora sdk](https://docs.agora.io/cn/All/downloads?platform=All%20Platforms). Unzip sdk file, replace corresponding files under deps/Agora folder. If ther version is a big update. For example the agora sdk interface used by plugin changed, you need adapt to the new version sdk.

2. You'll need [Qt 5.14.2](https://github.com/sbd021/Basic-Video-Broadcasting/releases/download/5.14.2/Qt5.14.2.zip),
[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and a working [OBS Studio development environment](https://obsproject.com/wiki/install-instructions) installed on your
computer.

### Windows

In cmake-gui, you'll have to set the following variables :

* QTDIR (path) : location of the Qt environment suited for your compiler and architecture
* LIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR (path) : location of the libobs subfolder in the source code of OBS Studio
* LIBOBS_LIB (filepath) : location of the libobs project
* OBS_FRONTEND_LIB (filepath) : location of the obs-frontend-api project 

For example, if the build directory is located in obs-studio src directory, named build64.

* LIBOBS\_INCLUDE\_DIR is obs-studio/libobs
* LIBOBS\_LIB is obs-studio/build64/libobs, 
* OBS\_FRONTEND\_LIB is obs-studio/build64/UI/obs-frontend-api. 

After configure camke, you get an variable LibObs_DIR, make sure its value is obs-studio/build64/libobs.


### Mac
Compile obs studio first, before you compile agora tool ui plugin. Reference obs studio compile document.

Use cmake-gui, set variable first:

* QTDIR ： Use the right version qt corresponding to conpiler, sucha as /usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.15.2/lib/cmake/Qt5
* 
* LIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR : the path libobs in obs studio source code path.
* LIBOBS_LIB: libobs path
* OBS_FRONTEND_LIB : obs-frontend-api path, such as:obs-studio/UI/obs-frontend-api

For example, obs source code path is obs-studio, build path is obs-studio/build64.

* LIBOBS\_INCLUDE\_DIR value is obs-studio/build/libobs
* LIBOBS\_LIB value is  obs-studio/build/libobs, 
* OBS\_FRONTEND\_LIB value is  obs-studio/build/UI/obs-frontend-api. 

Click configure on cmake-gui, then you get a variable LibObs_DIR. Make sure the value is obs-studio/build/libobs.
